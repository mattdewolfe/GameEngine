GameEngine
==========

Scaffolding and basic implementation of a complete engine done as a school project to create the systems as we learned about them. All systems function as desired, but several of them need to be expanded upon for practical usage. Resource Loading system is not in place (as it was not in the scope of the school project).

Dependencies: DirectX, FMOD, rapidXML, LUAPlus, FastDelgates (http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/FastDelegate.asp)
